In giving to the public this second edition I am glad to be able to,
offer a revised and improved cook book. It has been my aim to improve
it in every way and to make it as clear, practical and helpful as
possible.

The previous material has been carefully revised and changes made in
the wording where it was believed that the language could be improved
upon to make the author’s meaning more clear and comprehensible. A
radical change has also been made in the construction and arrangement
of the pages, which I trust will be an advantage.

In recognition of the friendly attitude of the great public toward my
first book, I wish to say that the entire edition of about 5,000
copies is scattered all over the country and many assurances of
appreciation have come to me. I therefore feel encouraged to send this
new edition out upon the world, knowing that it is the same excellent
cook book, only improved and augmented, and I hope that the book will
contribute materially to the happiness and attractiveness of many
homes and help to solve many problems, especially for brides and
beginners.

                                   Respectfully,
                                          MRS. LINA MEIER,

LAMB OR MUTTON.

Boiled and roasted mutton.

How scraps of mutton may be utilized.

The best time for lambs is from beginning of December to the end of
April. Good lamb meat is hard or firm and white and the fat also.
Avoid buying soft, reddish meat of lamb or mutton. The forequarter is
the most tender part of lamb.

The wether furnishes the best meat when he is 2 to 3 years old. Up to
one year it is called lamb meat or lamb, older than that it is called
mutton. Good mutton must be juicy, red and covered with a layer of
white fat.

Best parts for roasts are leg and loin.

Best pieces for braising and stews are leg, loin and breast.

Small pieces for frying, cutlets and steaks from leg.

Best meat to make bouillon is all lean meat, the feet, scraps of
cutlets and bones.

Mutton is less nourishing than beef. It may be kept fresh in vinegar,
buttermilk or sweet milk.

Especially old mutton will be more palatable after being kept in
vinegar or milk for a while.

THE CHICKEN.

The young chicken has a slender body and a delicate color. All young
poultry has long legs, soft skin, feathers with oily quill that can be
pulled out easily, small red comb, long claws and an elastic breast
bone.

Old hens have a small, pale comb. If you wish to keep poultry, hang it
up for a few days with the plumage, then pick it and dress it, stuff
it with white paper, hang it up or wrap it in a clean cloth and put it
on ice.

Poultry must not be cooked directly after slaughtering, because it
will not get tender. According to the season it will keep 1–3 days.

A young chicken is roasted or fried. It is best when 8 to 16 weeks
old. Old hens are good for cooking.

  Some water
  Some slices of bacon

The Gravy.

  1½ tbsps. of flour
  1 cup of broth

Preparation: Wild geese are usually very tough, therefore take a
young goose only. Clean and dress it well, let it soak in water for ½
hour, dry it and salt it inside and outside.

The filling or stuffing is made by heating the butter, chopping the
scalded onion and put into the butter together with the peeled and
sliced apples, cut into ⅛ths. Let these cook half done, then add 1
pinch of white pepper, salt and 2 pulverized cloves, fill the goose

injure the outer skin. The small fillets are separated from the breast
and it is rubbed well with ½ the quantity of salt, which has been
mixed with the saltpetre and sugar until it dissolves. Replace the
small fillets after salting them also, fold, and sew up the breast.
Salt it well on the outside and place into a crock for 7 days,
turning it twice a day and basting it well with the brine that
collects. On the eighth day wrap in paper, place it between two
boards, well weighted, and draw a string through the top end of fat
and skin by which to hang it up. Hang it into a smoke house in medium
smoke for 8 to 10 days. Then place again between two boards weighted
down for a few days. By this process the fat becomes white and hard
and the meat keeps better.

GAME.


Game must not be soaked in water and it should be washed only when
necessary and then quickly dried. The flavor of game depends greatly
on its preparation, the latter makes it one of the finest dishes. Game
ought to be fried and roasted; boiled game is never as savory.

Butter, bacon and cream are the best fats in which to fry game.
Sweet-sour victuals are best to serve with game as: Red cabbage, apple
sauce, currant jelly and Cumberland sauce.

CHAPTER 8.

FISH.

THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF FISH AND THE UTILIZING OF REMNANTS.


Every fish has a season when it is most savory. During the breeding or
spawning season, no fish is good. When you buy a dead fish, observe
carefully the following:

  1. The meat of the fish must be firm and must not show any form of
     decay, neither in smell nor taste.
  2. The skin must be tight on the fish.
  3. Both eyes must be clear, not milky or sunken.
  4. The gills must be red and slimy. Fish frozen very hard are not
     especially good.

The meat of middle sized fish is more savory than that of large ones.

When you buy live fish, take the lively ones, not those that swim on
their side or back. The bought fish are best killed in the market. The
quickest way of killing a fish is to stun it with a blow on the head
or neck, then cutting its throat and its tail.

You scale the fish by taking hold of its tail and with a sharp knife
or fish scaler scraping off the scales from there towards the head.

To retain the nourishing qualities of the fish, it is not soaked in
water, only washed and boiled immediately. Whole fish are put on the
fire with cold or hot water. Pieces of fish are put on with boiling
water or prepared in hot butter or lard to retain the nutriment in the
fish, since the hot water or fat contracts the cells at the cuts. The
skin of a whole fish retains the nutriment, therefore it may be put on
the fire in cold water.

Fish must not be covered up while cooking or frying so that the
temperature will not get too high. Frozen fish must be thawed
completely before using; if this is not done, the inside of the fish
is mostly rare when serving it. No dish will be good when the fish or
meat used is prepared in a frozen state.

Fish are dressed by making a slight cut along the whole under side and
taking out all intestines. The inner darker membrane must be entirely
removed and the fish washed well.

qts. of water, all the spices and enough salt to make it quite salty.
Place the fish on the tray of the kettle in a swimming position and
bring slowly to boil 5 minutes in cold or hot water, then set back to
draw ½ hour. When the meat near the gills is not bloody any more, the
fish is done. Before serving, rinse it with hot water to remove the
scum and place on the platter in a swimming position. It is then
garnished with lemon slices, parsley, lettuce and potatoes.

Glass jars are the best to put up preserves; tin cans must be soldered
and this cannot very well be done at home.

The kettle in which the preserves are cooked should be clean and kept
for this purpose only. The spoon or ladle used for stirring is best of
silver or new wood.

CHAPTER 25.

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS.


While the directions found throughout this book will be generally
adequate for the preparation of food for invalids or convalescents,
always carefully regulating and limiting the quantities of fats,
spices, condiments, etc., used, it is nevertheless deemed best to add
a separate chapter especially devoted to the enumeration of recipes
and directions intended for the sickroom. A majority of the sick and
invalids, are usually nervous and irritable, and as it is quite
essential that they receive the food prepared for them with all
possible readiness and pleasure, it becomes necessary that the manner
of presenting the meals to them should obtain great attention; even
this detail, if properly carried out, being of assistance to the
physician in successfully handling the case.

Invalids should seldom be consulted regarding their wishes as to food;
as a usual thing they are quite unable to make a decision, or at the
moment they lack the desire to determine upon anything they would like
to eat, and yet it is often observable that properly prepared and
appetizingly served dishes are eagerly received by them.

All the ingredients used in the preparation of dishes for invalids
must be faultlessly good. Meats, fish, poultry, vegetables and fruits
must be absolutely fresh and untainted. The natural fats of flesh
foods should not be used, and the very best butter only must be taken
when preparing food for invalids.

Water for cold beverages must always be boiled and artificially
cooled. Meals should never be prepared in the sickroom, because the
air becomes vitiated, the noise and activity inseparable from the work
itself is annoying to the patient, and is apt to diminish whatever
appetite he may happen to have. Never bring more victuals into the
sickroom than are necessary to supply present needs, because the air
in the room and the exhalations from the patient act deleteriously
upon the food, and may prove dangerous. All cooking utensils,
particularly in cases of contagious and severe illness, should be used
for that patient only; the most scrupulous cleanliness must, it is
perhaps needless to say, always be observed. The quality of many
dishes is impaired when they are cooked in utensils too large for the
purpose. Sick people are usually very sensitive in their taste, and
the slightest taint in an article of food prepared for them will at
once destroy all desire for it. The utensils should, as much as
possible, consist of small earthenware and enameled pots, kettles,
pans, spiders, etc.; a small bouillon pot with tightly-fitting cover
should also be provided. The dishes in which the food is served should
be adapted to the small portions given, because neatness in everything
connected with giving invalids their sustenance is certain to sharpen
the appetite; furthermore, the victuals are likely to cool too rapidly
when contained in large receptacles. For invalids who can only take
their food and beverages slowly, vessels provided with hot water
heaters are the best.

TREATMENT OF BURNS.

Since it often happens that you burn yourself while cooking and
baking, I shall give some methods of treating the wounds.

There are various kinds of burns:

1. When the surface is burned and a burning pain sets in, make cold
water applications or compresses of raw grated potatoes or lime water.

2. When the burn causes swelling and blisters, put on cotton batting
dipped in olive oil or the following mixture: equal parts of lime
water and linseed oil and a little thymol. Shake it well before using.

3. When the heat has destroyed the lower skin and the epidermis rises
in large blisters filled with a dark, bloody fluid. When the patient
has fever and nervous symptoms.

4. When the skin is completely destroyed and black, and the patient
has fever.

As a remedy for the last two cases use a mixture of carbolic acid and
water and apply it with cotton batting. For healing use white
vaseline, 20 grams; provence oil, 10 grams; glycerine, 50 grams; mix
well and spread on the wounds.


MEAT CARVING.

In order to carve meat properly it is necessary to know something
about the anatomy of meat, muscles, tendons and the skeleton.

The simplest carving is on meat without bones, as beef steak and roast
meat. Hold the meat with a large fork and cut across the grain or
fiber in not too thin slices. The knife must be held a little on the
slant.

Fricandeau of veal or fillet both have all the fibers running in the
same direction, so find out how they run and cut against the grain or
across the fiber.

For roast beef without bones the same must be observed. Mark carefully
that the vertebrae in the roast are chopped in two. Cut thin slices
from the whole width of the roast, fat and all, and pour a little of
the drippings over to make them juicy.

Leg of veal, mutton or game is carved on one side, first beginning at
the chump end of loin. Perpendicular and rather thick slices are carved.

The English way is to cut horizontal and very thin slices.

Venison is carved in slanting slices to keep the larded pieces together.

In carving ham you begin at the middle and cut around the bone.

To carve a saddle of lamb or veal or other meat requires some skill.
Hold the meat with the fork and make deep cuts along the backbone,
then place the knife in from below and shove it forward. In this way
you carve the meat from the ribs. Make slanting slices.

It is advisable to carve poultry in the kitchen.


CARVING OF POULTRY IN THE KITCHEN.

When poultry is the main course you cut larger pieces than if it were
served in ragout, or with vegetables or as a side dish.

Small birds, like quail or larks are served whole on toast and
are not carved.

Partridges, hazelhens, spring chickens and pigeons are cut in half
when they are the main course. With a poultry shears they are cut
lengthwise and the two halves placed together again and covered with a
hot gravy. When they are a side dish, they are quartered and the
backbones cut out. When they are fried, the breast is carved into 3
parts.

Turkeys, ducks, geese, chickens, pheasants and woodcocks when fried
are carved in the same way. The drumsticks or legs are cut around the
hip joint and then the joint separated. The wings with some breast
meat are cut off. The meat on the breast is carved from either side of
the breastbone and cut into desirable pieces. When serving, place them
together again to make the breast appear whole. The legs are also cut
into two or three pieces and replaced before serving.

ROASTING.

Roasting means the rapid confining of the meat’s juices by coagulating
the albumen in the surface tissues, the slow changing of the outer
layers into a brown palatable crust, dissolving of the natural fats of
the meat, changing the albumen gradually to a semi-fluid form and
loosening and breaking up the fibers by steam generated in the mass of
the meat. Roasting may be done on a stove in a pan, or over the open
fire on a spit, or in an oven.


ROASTING IN THE PAN—FRYING.

Heat a clean pan, put in the fat of the meat or butter and heat it;
the fat must be steaming and the butter have a light brown color
before the meat is put into the pan. Fat and butter mixed may also be
used.

Beef steak, veal, mutton or pork chops, liver, pork or veal steak,
etc., are cut into uniformly thick slices; the time for frying is
estimated according to the average weight of the pieces. Do not salt
too soon as this will draw out the juice. Breading must be done
immediately before frying, otherwise the juices of the meat will be
drawn out and the breading will not hold.

Do not leave meat on boards, as the juices will be absorbed by the
wood; it is better to put meat on china. The pieces of meat, the
largest first are placed in the hot fat with a cake turner, not with a
fork, and take note of the time when beginning. Never put so much meat
into the pan at one time as to cool the fat and stop its sizzling.
After every three pieces stop long enough to give the fat a chance to
heat up.

When several pieces, of meat are in the pan, they must be turned in
the order in which they were put in, baste frequently with the fat or
butter in the pan and turn often.

When done, the meat must be well browned but not hard on the outside,
and be reddish and tender inside. Stabbing the meat with a fork is not
advisable for two reasons. In the first place the juice will run out
and the meat will be dry, and then the meat will begin to stew in the
juice and the temperature of the fat will be reduced, the meat will
not turn brown; breaded meat loses the breading or this will be soft.
Washed meat must be well dried with a clean cloth before breading.
When fried meat is pale and colorless, it has been either fried in too
low a temperature or was stabbed with a fork or was not well dried
before frying.


BROILING.

Flat pieces of meat only are suitable for broiling, the fire must be a
fairly hot one, all coals aglowing. The broiler is greased with a bit
of bacon or suet and heated over the fire. Lay on the pounded slices
of meat and as soon as the same begins to blister, turn with a cake
turner. The meat must be rich and not too lean. The meat is seasoned
after broiling and hot butter may be poured over it before serving.


ROASTING IN THE OVEN.

In Germany roasts made in the oven are preferred on account of the
desired gravies.

Roast beef, fillet of beef, mutton, game and small birds require
comparatively little time for roasting, but a uniformly hot oven.

Veal, lamb, turkey and goose roasts require a longer time but only a
moderate heat. For roasting use only meats from full-grown, but not
old, animals. The cellular walls of the muscle tissues must be still
tender and filled with juice. In older animals the tissues become
harder and less juicy and such meat is better suited for stewing than
for roasting. Meats for roasting should be 2 to 3 days old and ought
to be slightly pounded.


FLOUR.

Good nutritive flour has a yellowish tinge on account of the nutritive
gluten contained therein; flour must not be gray, for this color
denotes impurities. The whiter the flour the larger is the proportion
of starch and smaller the proportion of albuminous substances. To test
flour, put some of it on a bluish white sheet of paper, where color,
finish and grain can be distinguished.

The finest brands of flour have less albumen than others, because this
is distributed near the outer shell, which is removed. Good flour
possesses a certain degree of cohesiveness which can be observed when
pressing some of it in the hand; poor flour acts like dust.

Flour made of grain not thoroughly seasoned is not well adapted for
gravies and baking. Adulterations and mixtures of good and poor flour
are easily detected in cooking and baking as the gravies are thinner
and cakes are liable to fall.

To keep large quantities of flour, the same must be placed high in a
covered wooden box in an airy place, so that the moisture of the floor
and air which is deleterious, may not affect it. Flour must turned and
sifted often.


YEAST.

Compressed yeast is the best to use; it must be fresh and to obtain
the best results in baking, the same must have an odor of fine brandy
or fruit and not smell cheesy or sour. Yeast must have a yellowish
white color, must be moist and break up in lumps, not like dust. To
retain activity, yeast must not be subjected to heat or great cold.

To obtain the best results in baking, the yeast needs careful
attention, drafts must be avoided and the baking room must be warm.


NOTICE.

Wherever the use of wine in recipes is prescribed and cannot be
obtained, take Ginger Ale.

MEMORANDA.


Just a Reminder.

“Lina Meier’s Genuine German Cooking and Baking,” when first
published, appeared in one volume, in English-German combined.

To meet a great demand of the public, the publishers have decided to
publish this, the second, revised and enlarged editions, in three
different volumes:

  One in the English language,
  One in the German language,
  One in English-German combined.

The books are all bound in full cloth and either one or all of the
different editions can be secured at any time through book stores or
from the publishers, by addressing:

  WETZEL BROS. PRINTING CO.,
  324–328 Broadway,
  Milwaukee, Wis.




Transcriber’s Notes.

  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in this text.

  Hyphenation variations are standardized.

  Ditto marks used to represent repeated text have been replaced with
  the text that they represent.

  Italic text is specified by leading and trailing underscores.

  Chapter 24 menu items were originally separated by em dashes. They
  have been placed on separate lines in this transcription.

  Errata has been incorporated into the text.

  The original book (as well as a German language edition) is available
  at the HathiTrust Digital Library and Internet Archive.

  Inconsistencies between the recipe ingredients and preparation text
  were resolved by referring to the German edition:

  Text corrections:

    No. 59—SOUR CREAM CAKE.

    1 cup sour cream replaced by 1 cup sour milk to match the English
    text and the German edition ingredient list.


    No. 16—CRACKER JACK.

    Added “and peanuts” to the end of the last sentence. This matches
    the German edition.


    No. 15—BARLEY SOUP WITH SWEETBREADS AND ASPARAGUS.

    Changed “add the parsley and sweetbreads” into “add the asparagus
    and sweetbreads” per German edition.


                      Yeast Measurements

Both the English and German editions of this work use the term “cents”
to specify a quantity of compressed yeast cake without giving further
definition. A rough definition can be found by comparing the Wheat
Bread No. 1 recipe (8 cups unsifted flour and 1½ cents’ worth of
yeast) to current bread yeast recommendations for the same quantity of
flour.

The Red Star Yeast Company website’s “Yeast Conversion” Table (November
2020) specifies 2½ packages (¼ ounce per packet) dry yeast for 8 cups
of flour. Therefore, as a first approximation:

  1 cents’ worth of yeast = 1⅔ packets or 3¾ tsp. dry yeast

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
